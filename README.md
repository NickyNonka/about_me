A repository showcasing me and my projects

# Hello, I'm Nick 👋

I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with experience in machine learning and modelling. I have worked with Python, SQL Lite, and Google BigQuery, and I'm familiar with Lasso and Ridge regression, cross-validation, and feature selection. I have used Pandas, Numpy for data wrangling and Seaborn and Matplotlib & Tableau for visualisation as well as Scikit-learn libraries in my projects.
